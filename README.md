The algorithm:
The main and most important part of the program was the creation of an array, and its corresponding structure, containing the information on the Exchange Offices and its connection through this same structure with another array containing the data on the currencies and their exchange rates. It is similar to accessing an array inside of another array , but not quite.   
The algorithm of “Status: Update”  consists of the main menu where the user can navigate through a variety of functions to either Insert data manually, download them or display the information on the console. The program has also the ability to find and display the Exchange Office selling the cheapest currency that is selected by the user. Lastly, the Exit and Update functions are also present where the user exits to the console or can select and update some specific currency. 
After the selection of an option from the menu follows the execution of the corresponding function. Then there is also the option to select again some function until the user decides to exit the program through the option “5. Exit”.
It is worth mentioning that the exchange data used in the making of this program are all real, and can be found in the websites of the Exchange Offices noted on the Bibliography.
